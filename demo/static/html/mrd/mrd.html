<h2>1. Strategy & Overview</h2><p></p>
<h3>1.1 Goals and Objectives</h3><p></p><p>
This product release, code-named "Nature", addresses the initial development a dairy farm business management system. The system will track purchase, feed, exercise, healthcare and milk production of dairy cattle.  The system provides real-time P&E per month and per year.  Cattle assets will be tracked by RFID reader.  RFID chips will be injected under the loose skin of the neck.  RFID readers will be installed at pasture gates and milking apparatus.  Manual actions by labor will be entered via RFID wand.
</p><p></p>
<h3>1.2 Customer Catetories</h3><p></p><p>
Target customers are assumed to be co-op managed dairy farms with cattle herds of 1000 head or less interested in tracking cattle by RFID.  
</p><p></p>
<h3>1.3 Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses</h3><p></p><p>
This is an emerging market.  No competition exists at the moment.  Nonetheless, although most activities common to dairy farming have been accounted for, there may be unanticipated special requests to be evaluated on a case by case basis.
</p><p></p>
<h3>1.4 External Positioning</h3><p></p><p>
Service launch is planned for the annual Dairy Association Conference in June.
</p><p></div>

<div id="bm"><h2>2. Business Model</h2><p></p>
<h3>2.1 Value Proposition</h3><p></p><p>
Dairy farming asset management is challenging due to common problems such as identification of individual cattle and real-time assessment of contribution to the farm.  Cows are easy to manage but milk quality and production is heavily influenced by health as determined by diet, exercise, illness and injury.  During good weather, cattle are encouraged to graze outside but during inclement weather, illness or injury, cattle must be housed in protective shelters and feed from grain stores.  Available pasture for grazing must be also periodically seeded and allowed to fallow.  Also, milk production increases to peak production then tapers off as cattle age forcing increased healthcare and eventual re-sale.  Also, cattle are referenced identified by breed, color and rought age yet many farms purchase several similar head of cattle preventing individual identification.  These problems become difficult to manage for herds greater than 100 head.  As large scale dairy farming is preferred, these problems can be eased with a business management system that tracks inventory and healthcare alerting farmers when to sell and where to find individual cattle.  Our solution requires RFID chip placement per head of cattle with wireless wands, readers and display console connected to an inventory management system in the internet cloud.  Our service would be leased to dairy farms based on herd size.
</p><p></p>
<h3>2.2 Market Segment</h3><p></p><p>
Service users would be cattle and dairy farm staff typically farmer, farmhands and vet.
They are non-technical so would use the Customer Service Hotline to report malfunctioning equipment.
</p><p></p>
<h3>Value Chain Structure</h3><p></p><p>
Prospective clients will be assessed for herd size, total number of pastures and integration of the inventory system into their business process. Then a cost estimate for services will be provided.  Wireless RFID readers are required for each pasture gate in order to route cattle to appropriate fields matching dietary needs.  Wireless RFID readers are also required for each milking station to register individual cow health and milk production multiple times per day.  Wireless RFID wands with barcode template charts allow farm staff to rapidly record special health problems such as detected injury or illness, and treatment given.   Reporting provides real-time assessment of profit and loss, asset management and alerts for sale of aging or low performing cattle.
</p><p></p>
<h3>2.3 Cost Structure</h3><p></p><p>
Dairy farm herd size must be 200 head to break even on equipment leased per year.  Larger farms offer increased revenue on a sliding scale with no upper limit although realistically, the largest farms currently do not exceed 5000 head so software performance will not require additional hardware.
</p><p></p>
<h3>2.4 Position within the Value Network</h3><p></p><p>
ACME inc. is an excellent supplier of RFID chips, chip readers and wands.   Widgets-R-Us is an excellent secondary source.  Both have been qualified as acceptable vendors as they are well-established, provide equipment that integrates with our software solution with minimal maintenance.  
</p><p></p>
<h3>2.5 Competitive Strategy</h3><p></p><p>
Currently, as this is an emerging market, we anticipate gaining market share through first player advantage and will reassess as competition appears.  Our VC backers claim this is a niche market with no competition and we already have a one year head start.

<div id="bom"><h2>4. Bill of Materials</h2><p></p>
<h3>4.1 RFID Chip</h3><p></p><p>
The Nature Dairy Farm RFID chip is injected just under the skin and is pre-equipped with a battery life of 5 years. The preferred injection location is the fatty folds of the neck just behind the head.  Typical cow moment will not dislodge or damage the chip but it can be deactivated and replaced by inserting an additional chip.
</p><p></p>
<h3>4.2 RFID Wand</h3><p></p><p>
The Nature Dairy Farm RFID Wand has an RFID chip is injected just under the skin and is pre-equipped with a battery life of 5 years. The preferred injection location is the fatty folds of the neck just behind the head.  Typical cow moment will not dislodge or damage the chip but it can be deactivated and replaced by inserting an additional chip.
</p><p></p>
<h3>4.3 RFID Reader</h3><p></p><p>
The Nature Dairy Farm RFID Reader has an RFID chip sensor range of 2' which if mounted on pasture access gates is adequate for sensing individual cows as the pass through or if mounted on a milking station above the frame that supports the head is adequate for sensing cows as they are milked.
</p><p></p>
<h3>4.4 Inventory Management System</h3><p></p><p>
The Nature Dairy Farm Inventory Management System is Wi-Fi accessible by browser.  User must register once then login for repeat use.

<div id="internal"><h2>5. Internally Committed Requirements</h2><p></p>
Items ranked in priority order, determined by Product and Development teams as achievable in the scheduled timeframe and as features invisible to the end user.
<h3>5.1 Elimination of Serious Defects</h3><p></p><p>
As QA tests the services, quality is assessed by severity.  Product reviews the list and re-assesses it by desired priority.  Engineering reviews the list again and re-assesses it by achievability within the timeframe allotted and dependent on available resources.  This portion of the document will change throughout the scheduled development timeframe as new issues are uncovered, existing issues are completed or require more time than estimated.
</p><p></p>
<h3>5.2 Internal Performance Improvements</h3><p></p><p>
In this organization, a portion of the QA team is dedicated to performance testing in order to uncover obvious delays displaying data or completing requested tasks as measured by response time.  Such testing is dependent on code completion, redundancy service availability and data set size.
</p><p></p>
<h3>5.3 Backward Compatibility</h3><p></p><p>
As this is a new set of services offered in an emerging market, there is no need for this feature at this time.
</p><p></p>
<h3>5.4 Next-Generation Architectural Changes</h3><p></p><p>
As this is a new set of services offered in an emerging market, actual market size is unclear so RDBMS with single message queue will be used until saturated.
</p><p></p>
<h3>5.5 Platforms and Protocols</h3><p></p><p>
Sensor hardware will be provided by the following qualified vendors which may be replaced by additional qualified vendors if needed.  Cloud support will rely on the technology stack specified below which can be migrated to a replacement cloud service provider if needed.
