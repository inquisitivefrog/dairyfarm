inspect_herd.py needs an algorithm change
1) at most, only 5% of herd should be injured or ill at any given time so
   ill = randint(1, 10)
   if ill == 1: 
       healthy_this_time = False
   else: 
       healthy_this_time = True
2) health markers measured need to switch from SmallInteger to Float
   but be calculated with only 1-2 decimals
3) randomness should be tight if healthy and loose if unhealthy
   if healthy_this_time:
       temperature = randint(980, 1020) * 10 / 100
   else:
       temperature = randint(960, 1050) * 10 / 100


4) tools/daily_herd_activity
   inputs: breed, date, user
   steps:
   health inspection
   if ill:
       see vet
       get innoculation
       rest in barn
       get walked around pen
       feed
       chew cud
       drink
   if injured
       see vet
       get treated
       rest in barn
       get walked around pen
       feed
       chew cud
       drink
   if not ill and not injured:
       herd to randomly assigned pasture
       graze
       chew cud
       drink
       nap
       make small talk
       round up
       
5) LOGIC
   inspection
       if unhealthy:
           diagnosis
           treatment
