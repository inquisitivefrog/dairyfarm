BASICS
AngularJS is a UI design framework in JavaScript perfect for SPA (Single Page Applications).
AngularJS is ideal for CRUD database applications.  ie. Create, Read, Update, Delete
AngularJS is freely available from Google.
Every Web page requires an HTML head containing two scripts:
01) a reference to a version of an Angular library 
02) a reference to a JavaScript app written in Angular

The logic is that
01) URL is accessed
02) if user has permission, web page is downloaded
03) web page HTML head references CSS and JavaScript to download as well
04) web page HTML body is loaded triggering any defined DOM events such as initialize
    app and call specific Angular App Controller
05) Angular app is loaded
06) Angular app controller is called
07) controller URL(s) are called, data is stored in variables passed to HTML templates
08) HTML element tag in page is replaced by HTML generated by template

Best Practices
01) Single CSS file per web page
02) Single APP file per web page
03) Single APP Controller file per web page
04) web page divided into sections easily created/updated by separate app controllers
    referencing separate HTML view templates
04) ng-app and ng-controller mapped to specific HTML element tags just like additional element
    tag attributes, ie. <div ng-app="farmApp">
05) CSS and view templates exposed as static files rather than inside Django apps so
    easily referenced by Angular JavaScript

Terms
01) prefix ng- or data-ng- wherein ng = Angular assigned to all directives
02) ng-init initializes variables within scope of app but $scope is preferred for local
    scope within controllers
03) ng-app defines app
04) ng-model binds HTML control value to app data
05) ng-bind binds app data to HTML view defined by HTML template
06) ng-value binds value of input or select element to $scope variable initialized and
    assigned later in app
07) ng-include allows insertion/replacement of HTML element tag content from external file
08) ng-controller identifies app controller to call when loading HTML element tag
09) {{ expression }} resolves simple math, string creation or display of bound variables
    and can exist in HTML but the range of possibilities is very limited
10) angular.module() defines an app and configuration consisting of controllers and routing
11) ng-view binds HTML template to current web page; requires ngRoute and mapping to HTML
    element tag owned by HTML element tag mapped to ng-controller
    ie. <div ng-controller="X"><div ng-view></div></div>
12) $scope.varX initializes varX within scope of controller hence available for binding
    and insertion in HTML template
13) ng-repeat="element in list" allows looping on object list
14) ng-show="varX" hides HTML element tag content until ng-model="varX" is assigned
15) directive is pre-defined or custom function to add page modification behavior
16)
